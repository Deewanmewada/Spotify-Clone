Spotify Clone ðŸŽµ
  Welcome to my Spotify Clone, a project designed to replicate the user interface of Spotify using only HTML and CSS. This project served as a practical way for me to learn and apply CSS concepts in a real-world scenario while developing a responsive and visually appealing web application.

Purpose of the Project ðŸ’¡
  The primary goal of this project was to enhance my understanding of CSS and practice key concepts such as:

Layout design (Flexbox and Grid)
  Positioning (relative, absolute, and fixed)
  Styling elements (buttons, cards, and icons)
  Responsive design principles (media queries)
  Working with colors, fonts, and animations
  By creating this Spotify clone, I gained hands-on experience in structuring a project and styling web pages effectively.

Features ðŸŒŸ
  Header Navigation: Includes a Spotify-like navbar with a logo, search bar, and user profile section.
  Sidebar Menu: A vertical navigation bar for playlists and music categories.
  Main Content Area: Displays playlists, album covers, and recommended songs in a grid layout.
  Footer Player: Mimics the Spotify music player with controls for play, pause, next, and previous.
  Responsive Design: Adjusts seamlessly across devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
